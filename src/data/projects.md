    summary: |-
      The Task List API is a comprehensive web application created as a project
      for Ada Dev Academy, focusing on efficient task management. It supports
      CRUD operations for tasks and offers advanced features such as task sorting,
      Slack feedback integration, and goal organization.

      While the project's original scope was limited to the API, a supplemental
      user interface was personally developed to expand my knowledge in
      JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This self-initiated addition offers users a
      dynamic, beautiful, user-friendly platform to manage tasks directly,
      utilizing JavaScript's Fetch API for seamless interaction with the Task
      List API.

      This venture exhibits my proficiency in RESTful routes, Flask models,
      external API usage, and front-end web development, demonstrating the
      capability to connect a bespoke API with a custom-built front-end interface
      in a full-stack application.
