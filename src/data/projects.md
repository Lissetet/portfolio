    github: 'https://github.com/lissetet/task-list-api'
    summary: |-
      The Task List API is a robust, web-based application developed to
      streamline task management. It allows users to create, read, update,
      and delete tasks remotely. Key features include task sorting, completion
      marking, feedback via Slack, and goal organization.

      In addition to the API, a front-end interface was also developed using
      vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This interface, built beyond the
      original project requirements, provides an interactive and user-friendly
      environment to manage tasks. It uses JavaScript's Fetch API to communicate
      with the Task List API, enabling users to perform all task operations
      directly from the web interface.

      The project demonstrates proficiency in using RESTful routes, managing
      Flask models, leveraging external APIs, and front-end web development.
      It also showcases the ability to create a complete, full-stack application
      by connecting a custom API with a self-built front-end interface.
